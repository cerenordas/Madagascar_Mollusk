Your project looks really interesting.
I have a few editorial suggestions:
You could number your pages, it makes it easier to refer to something on that page.
On the second page, I think 'hypothesize' would be a better word for 'predict'.
I think you can condense you materials and methods section, and also keep the headings consistent, eg sometimes you have a colon, sometimes you don't; sometimes your heading is a part of a sentence, sometimes it's not.
While condensing, I think you could remove some obvious steps like when you mention the program was loaded. That's common knowledge. The important thing is to mention what variables you pick, which you have also mentioned such as rates=gamma.
