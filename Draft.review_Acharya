Very informative introduction part.
Methods section could be condensed. It could also use some consistency in terms of what you are trying to convey. Also, I would suggest you to mention the sample size somewhere in here. 
You could include some more figures in your analysis. 
Although you have explained the naming of sequences in your results and discussions, it would be easy to follow if you mention them prior to the tree figure. 
You have done anamzing job explaining your results. I would suggest you to go through the Discussions and try to shorten it if you could. It sounds repititious in somecases. 
All in All very interesting work. Keep up the good work. :)
